# Cannabull Garden Controller
This project is intended to utilize a Raspberry Pie or Edison board with node.js to control your garden and environment. 

##Cannabull Roadmap
This is something I plan to build gradually over time as a side project, all helpers with interest are welcome to collaborate. To get in touch, please message Mathew.Smith@MoliviaDesign.com.

This project will be built in stages. The web app for controlling it all will be in the later stages, first, because I am not terribly proficient with node.js and or setting up servers with it, I plan to tackle this and learn it. I would absolutely LOVE assistance if you are great with node.js and interested in this at all. 

Please note that I am terrible with using GitHub, this being on GitHub is another part of my learning from the project, so if anything is out of form on here, constructive criticism is welcome. 

##Targeted Controlable Items:
-Lights (On/Off)
-Lights (Dimmer Switch)
-Fans (on/off)
-Fans (Speed)
-Pumps (On/Off)

-Alerts (To system)

##Rough Roadmap:
-Choose a platorm (Edison/Raspbetty Pi)
-Choose back end applications (node.js, Express.js, Jade (Pug)/Handlebars.js)
-Choose development platform (Web Storm etc.)
-Setup platform with all hardware and resources
-Setup back end with all software and resources
-Setup development platform 
-Get software working with all the hardware properly with no hiccups
-Determine data sets and write an API to interface with front-end web app
-Tie the front and back ends together and get them functional
-Document all hardware, links to where it can be purchased specifically
-Write documentation on how to set this up in your garden
-Make a pre-packaged all-in-1 solution that can be sold cheaply to anyone interested in getting this running with no issues. 
-Make that money.
